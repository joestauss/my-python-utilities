* __boxed_text__ is a pretty-print function that puts its args in a box.  Any iterables are unpacked and everything is given its own line.

* __cli\_selector__ gets a user's input from among a list of options.  It supports two modes of operation:
 - _single_ - User selects a single choice.  This is the default mode.
 - _many_ - User can input several choices separated by a comma.

*  __MenuLoop__ is a framework for a basic, repeating CLI menu-loop.

# Tests
