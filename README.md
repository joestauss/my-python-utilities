# my-python-utilities

This repository contains various general-purpose python tools that I use.


# Folders

The utilities have been grouped into folders by utility and by software design.  The folders contain a README that describes each class or function in detail.

* __Collection Classes__ contains mixins that add functionality to a collection class.
* __Command Line Tools__ can help with implementing a text-based interface.
* __Decorators__ has decorators for classes and functions.
* __File Management__ tools for working with the file system, download images.
* __Other__ some thread managers, an odd parser, and SQL.


# Versioning

In order to be able to refactor however and whenever I want, I will not be enforcing backwards compatibility on any of these utilities.  The current iteration of each utility will be versioned, as indicated by "#v\_" (where \_ is the version number) right after the docstring.
