# Test Suite

There are two types of folder in the test directory:

* **Unit Tests** are located in folders called _"ut.\_"_.  These folders have a *\_\_main\_\_.py*, so can be executed like a python script from here (their parent folder, _py_util/test_)

* **Demonstrations** are located in folders called _"demo.\_"_.  These folders are not executable, but contain scripts that demonstrate the functionality of utilities that can't easily be unit tested, like pretty-prints and interactive tools.
