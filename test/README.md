# Test Suite

There are two types of test directory:

* **Unit Tests** are contained in folders called _"ut.\_"_.  These folders can be executed from the command line like a python script to run all tests inside.

* **Demonstrations** are located in folders called _"demo.\_"_.  These folders are not executable, but contain scripts that demonstrate the functionality of utilities that cannot be unit tested.
